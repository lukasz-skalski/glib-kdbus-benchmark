Please find latests glib with kdbus transport here:

and test for it:

===============
= Description =
===============

In order to perform tests of glib with kdbus native support I've
created two programs: gdbus_server and gdbus_client. The first of
them acts as a server, registers itself on the bus under well-known
name and waits for calls to its objects and methods. The second one
(client) makes calls and records periods of time between moment of
preparing of a call to the moment of receiving and parsing an answer.
The measurement is made by performing one thousand of calls and
computing a sum of duration of every call (for different sizes of
message payload: 4kB, 8kB, 16kB, 32kB, 64kB, 128kB, 256kB, 512kB and
1MB). The client program returns total time of performed calls after
successful execution.


================
= Requirements =
================

* kdbus kernel module,
* modified version of glib (with kdbus native support),
* latest systemd from git repository


=========
= KDBUS =
=========

Simple install procedure:

 * git clone https://code.google.com/p/d-bus/ 	# download kdbus source
 * cd kdbus 					# change to kdbus directory
 * make 					# build kdbus module
 * insmod kdbus.ko 				# load kdbus kernel module


===========================
= GLIB (modified version) =
===========================

Please find latest patchset here:

https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=721861

Simple install procedure:

 * cd glib 					# change to glib directory
 * ./configure --enable-kdbus-transport 	# run the `configure' script
 * make && make install				# build GLIB


======================
= SYSTEMD-BUS-PROXYD =
======================

Here is a the step-by-step guide, how to setup a container with
systemd-bus-proxyd (from systemd) for kdbus testing:

http://people.freedesktop.org/~kay/kdbus-container-install.txt


=========
= TESTS =
=========

In container:

* Build test binaries:

  cd glib-kdbus-benchmark
  make

* Set variable to use custom library:

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=absolute_path_to_glib_libs_with_kdbus_patch

* Run server in terminal 1:

  ./gdbus_server

* Run client in terminal 2:

  ./gdbus_client

* Sample client app output:

  elapsed time : 0.265072 s
  elapsed time : 0.264353 s
  elapsed time : 0.305062 s
  elapsed time : 0.343710 s
  elapsed time : 0.451501 s
  elapsed time : 1.109851 s
